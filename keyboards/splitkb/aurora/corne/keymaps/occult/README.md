# Occult

This is a keymap created and authored by @AuditeMarlow for their SplitKB Aurora
Corne keyboard. I never really properly named this keymap, but there's a time
and place for everything I guess. I chose the name "Occult" as an irony of my
own belief that this keymap was something that fell outside the scope of what
was generally there, and that this keymap would be my final layout. I have
since accepted learned this keymap is both nothing special and far from a
keymap that I would consider perfect for me.
